# ðŸ“œ Changelog â€” UnRen Toolkit

All dates are in the format MM/DD/YY.

## ðŸŸ¢ 09/30/25 â€” UnRen-forall.bat (launcher) version 0.35 and UnRen-current.bat version 9.7.15:
  - minor bugs fixes and optimizations
  - More robust mcname change
  - URLlink for UnRen-link.txt moved to Google Drive
  - No more colors for Windows 7

Specific for UnRen-current.bat:
  - Added multi-lingual support
  - Some options are grayed out because I haven't done enough testing with unrpa, which allows extraction with a special key
  -  I started putting locks in place to limit usage on Ren'Py >= 8. So if all goes well, this will serve as the basis for the new UnRen-legacy.bat. This will make it easier for me to remove what is no longer necessary in each UnRen.
  -  You can select multiple options from main menu. By default you have the equivalent of option 9 from the old UnReb-forall.bat
  -  You can manage the default execution by downloading UnRen-cfg.zip, extract to where the scripts are and edit to modify MDEFS2 to reflect what you want to be the default action when UnRen-current.bat is launched
  -  After the first execution, the default entry for main menu will be x (Exit).
