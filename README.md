I've made this scripts with <3 for you and to simplify the management of your favorite games.

You have now a multilingual (de, en, es, fr, it, ru) launcher batch (UnRen-forall.bat) Version 0.28
a legacy batch (UnRen-legacy.bat) Version 9.6.43 for Ren'Py <= 7
and a current batch (UnRen-current.bat) Version 9.6.57 for Ren'Py >= 8

The launcher was initially designed to launch the correct batch depending on the Ren'Py version .
Then I realized that it would be useful to add options that do not depend on Ren'Py.
As I continued coding, additional ideas led me to add multilingual support and new independent features.
